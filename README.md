# Prompt-Atlas
Smarter prompts. Sharper minds. Modular AI blueprints.

PromptAtlas is a living archive of my original custom instructions, system prompts, and specialized conversational modes for AI assistants.

This project compiles my personal designs to build sharper, smarter, and more adaptive AI — for coding, consulting, research, creativity, and strategic thinking.

PromptAtlas is continuously evolving as I create and refine new methods for language-driven behavior shaping.

What's Inside
/custom-instructions/
Instruction sets crafted to reprogram AI response behavior.
Examples:

Anti-Sycophant Core (truth-first assistant)

Critical Coding Mode (error-finding assistant)

Strategic Social Assistant (structured posting and messaging)

/system-prompts/
Complete system messages for initializing conversation styles and default behaviors.
Examples:

Socratic Mode (question-first reasoning)

Strategy Mode (goal-first dialogue)

Drill Mode (technical depth-first answering)

/creative-prompts/
Prompts designed to unlock narrative, brainstorming, or brand strategy capabilities.
Examples:

Story Weaver

Brainstorm Booster

How to Use
Browse any folder.

Open the .md file you want.

Copy the prompt, instruction set, or system message.

Paste it into your AI’s Custom Instructions, system prompt field, or conversation starter.

Each design is modular — combine freely.
